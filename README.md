# BookHeaven Server
BookHeaven Server is part of the BookHeaven "ecosystem", which aims to provide a very convenient way to manage and read your ebook library.</br>
It allows to organize your books into authors and series, as well as add tags for filtering purposes.</br>
You can also add fonts so they can be easily downloaded and used by your devices.

## Disclaimer
- Only epub format is supported as of right now and there are currently no plans to support other formats.
- While the progress sync is completely functional and the UI is pretty enough, the "managing" part still needs a bit more of love. That being said, I want to keep things simple.
- There's no web reader, reading is done through the client app.

## Supported UI Languages
- English
- Spanish
